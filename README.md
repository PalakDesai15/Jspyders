# 👋 Hi, I’m Palak Desai  
**MCA Graduate – Class of 2025**  
Currently deepening my skills in **Java & DevOps** through hands-on training at **JSpyders** (by QSpiders).

---

## 🎯 What I’m Learning

### ✅ Core to Advanced Java
- Mastering **OOP**: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction  
- Java Collections, exception handling, file I/O, multi-threading  
- Connecting to databases via **JDBC**, building CRUD console apps

### ✅ Web & Frameworks
- Front-end basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- J2EE: **Servlets** & **JSP** for web apps and session management  
- Building enterprise apps with **Spring MVC** & **Hibernate**

### ✅ DevOps Toolchain
- **Git / GitHub** for version control  
- **Maven** builds and dependency management  
- **Jenkins** pipelines for CI/CD  
- **Docker** containers & `docker-compose`  
- **Kubernetes** deployments and services  
- **Ansible** for infrastructure automation and Linux/AWS fundamentals

## 🎬 Demo — See It In Action!

Check out my Spring Boot app startup as it boots up inside a Docker container:

*To add such a GIF, I uploaded it in the `assets/` folder and embedded it as Markdown—GitHub supports relative paths for images in READMEs* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
